methods: We produce different intervention scenarios, assuming various interventions
  and rates of compliance are implemented in the future. This projection assumes relatively
  high transmission.

methods_long: 'This metapopulation county-level SEIR model makes projections of future 
  COVID-19 incidence and deaths.  We produce a number of different intervention scenarios,
  each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the
  future.  
  November 8 - present: ''season4'': This scenario assumes seasonal changes to R(t). 
    In the summer months, it assumed a seasonal decrease in disease transmission leading to a 
    weekly 4% decrease in reproductive number R(t). In the winter, it assumes a weekly 2% increase in 
    reproductive number R(t).  
  October 4 - November 5: ''5_2xhold'' This scenario assumes a weekly
    5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction
    number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.  
  August 23 - September 27:''1x5p'' We project a one-time 5% increase in contact
    rates due to loosening restrictions as states continue to reopen economically, applied
    at the beginning of the projection.
  July18 - August 22: ''5_2xhold'' This scenario assumes a weekly
    5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction
    number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection. 
  June 14 - July 18: ''1x5p'' We project a one-time 5% increase in contact
  rates due to loosening restrictions as states continue to reopen economically, applied
  at the beginning of the projection. May 3 - June 7: ''80contact1x10p'' For states
  maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20%
  weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that
  reopen, we apply an increase to the contact rates of counties in those states. In
  the first scenario, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rates during
  the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain these new increased
  rates for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26: ''80contact'' This
  scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations
  (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation
  (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections,
  all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 20% contact rate reduction.
  Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 20% contact
  rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had
  previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number
  of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 20% contact
  rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario. '
